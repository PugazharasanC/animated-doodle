# animated-doodle


This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Git Hub.


Things I did for making this repository.

+ Created an empty repository named `animated-doodle` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
+ Copied the contents from the page titiled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are
```
echo "# animated-doodle" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/PugazharasanC/animated-doodle.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After Opened CMD I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
  + This First line `echo "# animated-doodle" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the content `"# animated-doodle"`.
